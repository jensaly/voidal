FIXME: Cephes math lib
Copyright (C) 1984-1998 Stephen L. Moshier

It sounds vague, but as to be found at
<http://lists.debian.org/debian-legal/2004/12/msg00295.html>, it gives an
impression that the author could be willing to give an explicit
permission to distribute those files e.g. under a BSD style license. So
probably there is no problem here, although it could be good to get a
permission from the author and then add a license into the Cephes files
in MinGW runtime. At least on follow-up it is marked that debian sees the
version a-like BSD one. As MinGW.org (where those cephes parts are coming
from) distributes them now over 6 years, it should be fine.
